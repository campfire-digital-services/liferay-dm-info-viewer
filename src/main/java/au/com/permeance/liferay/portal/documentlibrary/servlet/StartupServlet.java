 * In testing, we are experiencing in some cases if the plugin security manager has been enabled,
 * registered ServletContextListener(s) would not fire (plausibly due to timing between when the
 * deploy event is set and when SecurePluginContextListener registers it). This happens on both CE
 * and EE.
 * 
 * This startup servlet is a workaround for those cases that need it.
